    "# Intermediate SQL Queries - Planet Express Database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the **Intermediate SQL Queries** class! In this session, we will explore various SQL techniques such as filtering, grouping, sorting, aggregation, and especially **joins**. You will apply these concepts using the **Planet Express** database, inspired by the Futurama universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please open [Sandbox SQL](https://sandboxsql.com/) and create a new database using the Planet Express template.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Planet Express?\n",
    "Planet Express is the intergalactic delivery company from Futurama. It employs a quirky crew of delivery personnel, including Fry, Leela, and Bender, who transport packages across the universe. The database simulates this companyâ€™s operations, tracking shipments, employees, packages, and deliveries to different planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's Add Some Records\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Shipment (ShipmentID, Date, Manager, Planet) \n",
    "VALUES (6, '3004/05/11', 1, 6);\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Package (Shipment, PackageNumber, Contents, Weight, Sender, Recipient) \n",
    "VALUES (6, 1, 'Undeclared', 8, 3, 5);\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO Package (Shipment, PackageNumber, Contents, Weight, Sender, Recipient) \n",
    "VALUES (7, 1, 'A crate of Slurm', 12, 4, 6);\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Concepts and Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Filtering Data (`WHERE` Clause)\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Retrieve all shipments sent to **Mars**  (Look for Mars PlanetID):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Shipment\n",
    "WHERE Planet = {Mars PlanetID};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Sorting Data (`ORDER BY`)\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "List all packages, sorted by weight in descending order:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Package\n",
    "ORDER BY Weight DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Aggregation (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Find the number of shipments made to each planet:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Planet, COUNT(*) AS ShipmentCount\n",
    "FROM Shipment\n",
    "GROUP BY Planet;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example with `HAVING`:\n",
    "Find planets that have received more than 10 shipments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Planet, COUNT(*) AS ShipmentCount\n",
    "FROM Shipment\n",
    "GROUP BY Planet\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `INNER JOIN`: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.\n",
    "- `LEFT (OUTER) JOIN`: Retrieves all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.\n",
    "- `RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN`: Retrieves all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.\n",
    "- `FULL (OUTER) JOIN`: Retrieves all records with a match in either the left or right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![join_img](./img/img_joins.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: `INNER JOIN`\n",
    "Retrieve package details along with the recipient's name:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT p.PackageNumber, p.Contents, p.Weight, c.Name AS RecipientName\n",
    "FROM Package p\n",
    "INNER JOIN Client c ON p.Recipient = c.AccountNumber;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: `LEFT OUTER JOIN`\n",
    "Retrieve all packages, including those that do not have a matching recipient in the Client table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT p.PackageNumber, p.Contents, p.Weight, c.Name AS RecipientName\n",
    "FROM Package p\n",
    "LEFT JOIN Client c ON p.Recipient = c.AccountNumber;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`\n",
    "Retrieve all clients, including those who have never received a package:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT p.PackageNumber, p.Contents, p.Weight, c.Name AS RecipientName\n",
    "FROM Package p\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN Client c ON p.Recipient = c.AccountNumber;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: `FULL OUTER JOIN`\n",
    "Retrieve all packages and clients, including those without a match on either side:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT p.PackageNumber, p.Contents, p.Weight, c.Name AS RecipientName\n",
    "FROM Package p\n",
    "FULL OUTER JOIN Client c ON p.Recipient = c.AccountNumber;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Using `WITH` for Subqueries\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Find the heaviest package per shipment:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH MaxWeight AS (\n",
    "    SELECT Shipment, MAX(Weight) AS MaxPackageWeight\n",
    "    FROM Package\n",
    "    GROUP BY Shipment\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT p.Shipment, p.PackageNumber, p.Weight\n",
    "FROM Package p\n",
    "JOIN MaxWeight mw ON p.Shipment = mw.Shipment AND p.Weight = mw.MaxPackageWeight;\n",
    "```"

    "Complete the following queries in **Sandbox SQL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find all employees with clearance level 3 or higher on any planet.**\n",
    "2. **List all shipments that have more than 1 package.**\n",
    "3. **Retrieve the total weight of packages sorted from heaviest to lightest.**\n",
    "4. **Find the planet that received the most shipments.**\n",
    "5. **List all clients who have sent or received packages, along with the number of packages associated with them.**"
